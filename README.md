Analyzed Employees- Current/Previous and Bad hires

"By using people analytics you don’t have to rely on gut feeling anymore. Analytics enables HR professionals to make data-driven decisions."

• Current Employees: Showed current employed resources by BU/Region, Age, Gender, Ethnicity and Employee Count per VP.

• Former Employees: Showed Former employed resources by BU/ Region, Age, Gender, Ethnicity and Employee Count per VP

• Bad Hires: (employees who didn't last for more than 60 days) Showed Data by Age Group, Gender, Compare year on year by month, Show bad hires per VP.

• Created a basic theme 

• Theme needed to be edited so that headers text etc. is formatted the same and made sure the report is neat and presentable, items aligned same size where needed etc..

• Made use of page navigation and at least 1 bookmark.

• Filters throughout the report: Date ,Region, Gender, Age group (if I move from page to page filters should be applied if I have selected anything)
